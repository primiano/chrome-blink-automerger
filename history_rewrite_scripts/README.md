Variant of the blink merger for mass clang-format-ting blink.

Open bug: does not know how to deal with the merge commit. Can only rewrite the part before.

Usage: ./blink_mass_clang_format.py -n -r d32c4abb19d448507a840db6f41c4edf42678cc3
It expects that /mnt/clang-format and /mnt/.clang-format exist.
